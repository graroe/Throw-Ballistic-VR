C# scripts for my protoype VR game Throw Ballistic.
Unity project and assets not included.

Game description
An exciting action game where the player must survive as long as possible against a
tide of nefarious robotic enemies by catching their attacks and throwing them right back!
Players can move about freely to dodge, or position themselves for the perfect catch.
Anyone can play, and no knowledge of games or VR is required. You don't even need to
press any buttons! Simply move your arms and body in natural ways, and soon youâ€™ll
land some satisfying throws. But look out: the longer you survive, the harder it gets! Can
you last longer than your friends?
